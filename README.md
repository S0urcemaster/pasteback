# Pasteback

With Pasteback you can store common terms and paste them back to clipboard
when needed.

There is one central spot to put every string into you need.
Either it's admin stuff like paths or commands or programmer's stuff
like build commands, sql or regex strings - if needed more than once:
paste it back.  
You can even use it as a tiny wiki or a bookmark list. You can have 26x26
entries per instance.

## Setup
- Copy the executable to your home/pasteback directory.
- Set an alias in .bashrc: `alias tt="/home/username/pasteback/pasteback"`.
- Now you can call pasteback from anywhere with `tt`.

## Usage
- type `tt` to start.
